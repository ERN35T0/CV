## Ernesto Baquero

Hi! I currently live in Lanzarote, Canary Islands and I am a junior developer. I worked for several years in the telecommunications industry and in my last job I was managing a team of 13 people in Madrid. 

I've started to code in December. I've enrolled in Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science and it has been extremely challenging and interesting so far. In February, I took part in the intensive 26-days experience of La Piscine with the School 42 in Madrid and we can call that a life changing experience! In May I started a course to master the Scrum framework, The Agile Program, and during the summer full stack web developer with Le Wagon.:blush:

So far, I've create a couple of proyects in rails, programs in C and I dabbed in Python and Flask. I like to understand how things work and coding offers me both the mental challenge and the satisfaction of having made something entirely by myself.

Over the next few months I want to complete CS50, create projects with other programmers and join in a company who will give me the opportunity to apply my skills to helping them grow.
