## Ernesto Baquero

I'm a Spanish living in Lanzarote, Canary Islands and I've worked several years in the telecomunications industry. I've recently started to learn code. I've create a couple of programs in C.

I like to understand how things work and also to build things from scratch. Coding offers me both the mental challenge and the satisfaction of having made something entirely by myself.

Over the next months I'm interested in fleshing out my understanding of C by completing Harvard CS50 course together with a couple of people on building something new and useful. I'm very curious and customer oriented and I have many ideas of apps, websites or simple software.


## Developer Skills

I can write simple C programs. My main quality is that I write readable code.
